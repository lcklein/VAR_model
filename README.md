Abstract:

The present article aims to empirically analyze the relationship between the exchange
rate and the Brazilian price index, IPCA, from 2010 to 2022. For this purpose,
a thorough review of the literature will be conducted, followed by the presentation
of empirical results obtained through the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methodology.
Regarding the theoretical aspect, there are various approaches to the subject, both in
the microeconomic and macroeconomic realms. However, this work will focus solely
on the macroeconomic approach to highlight the impact of exchange rates on domestic
prices in a more aggregate manner. As for the results, the estimation reveals a
low degree of exchange rate pass-through to prices, as the analyzed period exhibits
vectors that limit this type of dynamics.
